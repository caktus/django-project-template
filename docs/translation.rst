Translation
===========

Resources
---------

This project uses the standard `Django translation mechanisms
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/i18n/>`_.

We use `Transifex <https://www.transifex.com>`_ to make it easy for translators
to convert the English strings in our interface to proper translated strings in
other languages.


What goes in version control?
-----------------------------

While the ``.po`` files can be regenerated easily by running ``make
makemessages`` again for English or ``make pullmessages`` for the translated
languages, we still store them in Git to make it easier to keep an eye on
changes, and revert if needed. That way we are less likely to accidentally make
a mistake and delete huge swaths of messages without noticing it.

We also store the ``.mo`` files in Git because those are what Django gets the
translated messages from at runtime.


First time setup
----------------

Steps 1 and 2 only need to be done once. Step 3 would only need to be repeated
if you were to add a new PO file to be translated. An example would be if you
were to add frontend JS translations.

1. Create a project on Transifex. This documentation will assume that you named
   it ``{{ project_name }}``.

#. In the repo, create your Transifex config file::

     tx init

#. Tell Transifex where your files are, and how to link them to Transifex::

     tx set --auto-local -r {{ project_name }}.djangopo \
         'locale/<lang>/LC_MESSAGES/django.po' \
         --source-lang en --type PO --execute

#. Commit this to the repo::

     git commit -m "Setup Transifex translation" .tx
     git push


Updating messages on Transifex
------------------------------

Anytime there have been changes to the messages in the code or templates,
a developer should update the messages on Transifex as follows:

1. Make sure you have the latest code from develop::

     git checkout develop
     git pull

#. regenerate the English (only) .po files::

     make makemessages

#. Run ``git diff`` and make sure the changes look reasonable.

#. If so, commit the updated .po file to develop and push it upstream::

     git commit -m "Updated messages" locale/en/LC_MESSAGES/*.po
     git push

#. Push the updated source file to `Transifex
   <http://support.transifex.com/customer/portal/articles/996211-pushing-new-translations>`_::

     make pushmessages


Updating translations from Transifex
------------------------------------

Anytime translations on Transifex have been updated, someone should update our
translation files on the develop branch as follows:

1. Make sure you have the latest code from develop::

     git checkout develop
     git pull

#. Pull the updated .po files from `Transifex
   <http://support.transifex.com/customer/portal/articles/996157-getting-translations>`_::

     make pullmessages

#. Use ``git diff`` to see if any translations have actually changed. If not,
   you can stop here.

#. Look at the diffs to see if the changes look reasonable. E.g. if translations
   have vanished, figure out why before proceeding.

#. Compile the messages to .mo files::

     make compilemessages

   If you get any errors due to badly formatted translations, open issues on
   Transifex and work with the translators to get them fixed, then start this
   process over.

#. Run your test suite one more time::

     python manage.py test

#. Commit and push the changes::

     git commit -m "Updated translations" locale/*/LC_MESSAGES/*.po locale/*/LC_MESSAGES/*.mo
     git push
