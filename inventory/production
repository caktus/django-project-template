# This is the inventory file for the production environment.

# List each hostname here on its own line. You can add
# variable definitions that are specific to that host after
# it on the same line. For example, you might want to use
# a short name to refer to a host in Ansible but set its IP
# address as a host variable so Ansible knows how to get to it,
# like this:
#
# web1 ansible_ssh_host=192.168.0.3

# EDIT THIS!


web1 ansible_ssh_host=192.168.0.1
web2 ansible_ssh_host=192.168.0.2
db1 ansible_ssh_host=192.168.1.1
